; -> log stuff and review instead of instantly looking at it
; -> have super easy interface to capture stuff and resurface at relevant time (i.e. when switching to a different mode)
; modes: custom purpose environments
; -> bind keys to apps diffently (show message about work mode when pressed)
; -> tip: try to use consistent mappings across modes
; -> track time active in different modes
; -> provide a quick switcher to switch between mode (menu bar could display text as reminder)
; -> run more or less arbitrary stuff to enter and switch between work modes
;    -> block distracting websites
